Strategy Pattern
-----------------
	=>The strategy pattern is intended to provide a means to define a family of algorithms,    		encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable select algo at run time 		convert IS-A to HAS-A

	=> It separate algorithms into classes that can be plugged in at runtime.
 
	=> I need to provide discount strategy for code flexibility 

	=> used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client
	 decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.
